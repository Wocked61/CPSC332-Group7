<h1>Library Management System</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The Library Management System is a full-stack application designed to automate and streamline library operations by providing tools for managing books, users, and borrowing activity. It allows administrators to add, update, and track books, manage patron accounts, and monitor inventory, while users can search the catalog, check availability, and borrow or return items through their accounts. The system replaces manual record-keeping with a centralized, efficient, and user-friendly platform that improves accuracy, reduces workload, and supports features like due-date tracking, overdue reminders, and borrowing history. Overall, it demonstrates practical skills in database design, CRUD functionality, user authentication, and responsive interface development./p><br>
